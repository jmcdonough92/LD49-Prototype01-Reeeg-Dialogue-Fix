    Later that night...
    Part 1
    As you lie there, trying to sleep among the familiar creaking of the ship, you hear voices, raised briefly. 
    <<show KaitAngry>>

	Kait: You have to take this more seriously, Gio.
    <<hide KaitAngry>>

	Gio: Someone needs to remind her that itâ€™s still ok to laugh. To feel things.
    The voices fall, and you drift off to sleep, trying to remember the last time something was funny.
