    Miss Turnia: I see the sweet cumulus crumbles came back for a visit! How are you doing, dears? Can I get you something to eat while you wait for your payment?

    You close your mouth and shake your head, unable to keep your eyes from darting to a plate of food near the door.

    Miss Turnia: Well enough darlings. Iâ€™ll leave a tray of honey cakes for you if you change your minds, but be safe out there flying in the Void.

    The cakes do not last long after she leaves. After all it will be another long hunt before you get to taste sweets again.
